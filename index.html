        I like to make things. 
       In the last year I discovered, I dont even need a pen or paints.
       I was writing a  story when I had an idea. 
       what if the very things I dreamt for my characters could be more than fiction? 
       what if with the right tools I could make them a reality?
       So here I am, trying to answer my own question by new developing skills.

            <p>18 years old. Avid reader and daydreamer with a passion for writing flash fiction.
              I was a strong believer in live it to write it.

            <p> 19,I kept writing and started to pursue a career in events and hospitality.
              grabbing opportunites to try and experience life. I took a foundation year
              in psychology at Goldsmiths, to better understand how  the mind works

            <h2>2017</h2>
            <p>20, I moved out of my parents home and began working fulltime, my creativity blossomed.
              I began painting and became entrenched in writing a new kind of narrative. My obsession
              with science fiction and dystopias greatly influenced my work during this time. However I found
              myself truly enjoying hospitality,  I switched into bars and pubs in hopes
              of greater opportunites and a schedule that would allow me to nurture my natural talents.

            <p>21, I took a break. It was time to breathe. I had undergone several massive life changes
              and I felt it in my best interest to take a moment, to heal, reflect and get ready for the sprint ahead.

            <p>This year was truly fast paced. I joined a pub group at the end of 2018 and worked header
              to work my way up and prove myself to be a valuable asset. Due to this, I recieved two promotions
              and pay rises. I was hungry to learn more and do more, I felt unstoppable.

            <h2>2020</h2>
            <p>The year that forced me to stop. During the pandemic, I got back in touch with myself and my creativity.
              I realised I wanted something new and I started to think about what that may be. I started writing again,
              a story set in a near future. It featured an app, fully integrated into daily life, mobilised with
              micro-tech. I thought to myself, If I could write it, why not make it? I approached a friend and we got to
              work. Eventually I grew frustrated that I could not write or understand code myself. 
              It was time to learn, I aimed to become literate in javascript within the next year!
